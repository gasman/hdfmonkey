hdfmonkey: A Swiss Army Knife for manipulating HDF disk images

ABOUT
-----
hdfmonkey provides a suite of tools for working with FAT filesystems contained
in HDF disk images. HDF is the standard format used for virtual hard disks in
ZX Spectrum emulators such as Fuse <http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/>, so
hdfmonkey allows these disk images to be prepared without having to go through
a physical disk as an intermediate step - particularly useful when developing
software for FAT-supporting systems like ESXDOS and ResiDOS.

Commands provided include:
clone, create, format, get, ls, mkdir, put, rebuild, rm

These commands are passed as a parameter to hdfmonkey along with any other
required arguments:

    hdfmonkey <command> <disk-image> [other params]

For further information on command formats, type 'hdfmonkey help'.

INSTALLING
----------
From a tarball (see http://files.zxdemo.org/gasman/speccy/hdfmonkey/):

    tar xzf hdfmonkey-0.4.tar.gz
    cd hdfmonkey-0.4
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

From git:

    git clone https://github.com/gasman/hdfmonkey.git
    cd hdfmonkey
    autoheader
    aclocal
    autoconf
    automake -a
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

From git into a Debian source package:

    git clone https://github.com/gasman/hdfmonkey.git
    dpkg-source -b

From git into Debian binary package:

    git clone https://github.com/gasman/hdfmonkey.git
    cd hdfmonkey
    fakeroot debian/rules binary

TODO
----
Implement a FUSE / MacFUSE filesystem driver, so that the disk image can be
mounted and accessed by standard OS file operations.
